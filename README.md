# Fallout Terminal
---
A React implementation of Fallout's Terminal.

Don't know how to hack Fallout terminals? It's okay. The wiki has a guide  [here](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Terminal#Hacking_terminals)

Technologies used:
  * [React](https://reactjs.org/)
  * [Glamorous](https://glamorous.rocks/)
  * [Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/)

Todo:
* Add typing sound.
* Add a bigger password pool.
* Make the init process spectacular by gradually showing codes.
* Change the success and fail screen so the user feels more rewarded or totally incapable respectively.

*It's not working on tiny screens. Sorry. Maybe one day*
